# Assembler

The goal was to write a program that will simulate an assembler and will execute machine code. The project built on itself each week. Initially we were just asked to execute instructions that would move values into memory locations, but later on we had to sort arrays and manipulate the stack.

Project Parts:

Part 1: Write the code that will move a constant into a register. Test it by moving different numbers into each register.

Part 2: Write the code that will add two constants and put the resulting value into a memory location.

Part 3: Put two values into the memory in the assembly code file. Add the two values and place the resultin a third memory location. Output the total.

Part 4: Modify the program above and output onto the screen the larger of two numbers. You need test for the three possible combinations of two numbers: the first is greater than, the first is less than and two numbers that are equal.

Part 5: Write a program that will add up 10 numbers entered by the user. Store the result in a memory location and output the result the total to the screen. You must use a loop.Part 6:Modify the above program so that it has a function with parameters and a return value.  The function will make sure the number entered is in the range of 0 â€“ 100. The number in range is returned. The parameters are the range.

Part 7: Write the function again the number is passed by reference. You will be getting the range that is needed in part 6. So you must have pass in the address of where the answer is and then place the number in range in the memory location.

Part 8: Write a program that will put numbers into an array then sort the array into ascending order. You will need to make your memory bigger at this point. Use three functions, a fill array, print array and a sort array, Make sure your sort routine will work on different sizes of arrays.
